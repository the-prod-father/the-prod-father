- 👋 Hi, I'm @the-prod-father (G Mac). I'm the founder and AI Product Builder at Why Not Us Labs. I'm obsessed with turning the impossible into possible. My time at Axon taught me to win against the odds by leading massive deployments, securing huge contracts and delivering under pressure. Setbacks are just moments; they never stop me. I value candor, momentum and friendly encouragement, and I love witty banter to keep energy up.

- 👀 I'm interested in building world-changing AI products, exploring frontier technologies like generative AI and robotics, and connecting bold ideas with hands-on execution. Big thinking and calculated risk taking drive me, and I'm passionate about communities where candor and celebration coexist.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about reinforcement learning and advanced machine perception, refining my craft in building reliable large language model systems and exploring sustainable leadership practices to keep teams both focused and having fun.

- 💞 I'm looking to collaborate on early stage AI ventures, open source projects that push boundaries and any opportunities to turn bold concepts into reality. If you're on a mission to build something that matters and you appreciate some wit along the way, let's talk.

- 💋 How to reach me: get in touch via GitHub, or find me on LinkedIn or Twitter to chat about ideas and potential collaborations.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love dad jokes and witty sarcasm. I'm a champion of celebrating wins and laughing through setbacks, and I believe momentum is non negotiable but keeping things fun is just as important.

- 💼 Job history: At Axon I built and managed digital evidence products from camera capture to courtroom presentation. I focused on Axon Evidence, Axon Investigate and Third‑Party Video Playback. In Axon Evidence I led features like automated upload and tagging of body‑worn and in‑car footage, encryption and audit trails to preserve chain of custody, multi‑camera synchronization and AI‑powered redaction and transcription. On Axon Investigate I worked with investigators to support playback of thousands of proprietary video formats by converting and normalizing files without altering metadata and enabling side‑by‑side comparison and annotation. I also launched Third‑Party Video Playback in Axon Evidence so agencies can ingest, review, store and share video from CCTV, security systems and community uploads with confidence they're seeing accurate playback every time. My work unified first‑party and third‑party video workflows into a seamless pipeline—capturing, converting, organizing, redacting, transcribing, syncing and presenting digital evidence securely for prosecutors and courts.
